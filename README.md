# dlb_ad_classification

Code for our ClinicalNLP 2020 paper: "Distinguishing between Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using Mental Health Records: a Classification Approach".

This is implemented partially based on [glove-text-cnn](https://github.com/aayux/glove-text-cnn) and [temperature_scaling](https://github.com/gpleiss/temperature_scaling).
